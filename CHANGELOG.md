## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-06

### 🎉 Initial Release

#### Phase 1: Core Framework
- 5 Agent roles: Acceptor, Designer, Implementer, Reviewer, Tester
- FSM state machine with 10 states and guard rules
- Task board with optimistic locking
- Goals-based task tracking (pending → done → verified)
- Agent messaging via inbox.json

#### Phase 2: Enforcement & Auditing
- Shell hooks for agent boundary enforcement
- Pre-tool-use boundary checking
- Post-tool-use audit logging
- SQLite events.db for activity tracking
- Security scan (pre-commit secret detection)

#### Phase 3: Automation
- Auto-dispatch: task state changes trigger downstream agent notification
- Staleness detection: warn on tasks idle > 24 hours
- Batch processing mode: agents process all pending tasks in a loop
- Monitor mode: Tester ↔ Implementer auto fix-verify cycle
- Structured issue tracking (JSON + optimistic locking)

#### Phase 4: Memory & Visualization
- Auto memory capture on FSM stage transitions
- Smart memory loading (role-based field filtering)
- ASCII pipeline visualization in agent status panel
- Project-level living documents (6 docs in docs/)
- Event summary in status panel (24h activity per agent)

#### Phase 5: Best Practices Integration
- Implementer: TDD discipline (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR + git checkpoints + 80% coverage gate)
- Implementer: Build fix workflow (one error at a time)
- Implementer: Pre-review verification (typecheck → build → lint → test → security)
- Reviewer: Severity levels (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) with approval rules
- Reviewer: OWASP Top 10 security checklist
- Reviewer: Code quality thresholds (function >50 lines, file >800 lines, nesting >4)
- Reviewer: Confidence-based filtering (≥80% confidence)
- Reviewer: Design + code review (can route back to designer)
- Tester: Coverage analysis workflow
- Tester: Flaky test detection and quarantine
- Tester: E2E testing with Playwright Page Object Model
- Designer: Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
- Designer: Goal coverage self-check
- Acceptor: User story format for goals
